FIFO Scheduling Algorithm from Publication - DOI: 10.2514/1.I010620

Refer the README-FIFO_Scheduling document for more info on the script.

DataFrame is used as the preffered data structure because of the ease of working and ability to
handle and process huge amounts of data

Inputs expected & Data types:
1. Download Candidate Intervals (DwInt) - Dictionary:
Data format is a dictionary of Pandas DataFrame for every satellite given by the structure
-index- | -Dwd_Task_ID- | -Ground_Station_ID- | -Download_SetUp_Time- | -Download_Start_Time- | -Download_Processing_Time- 
the identifier (key) for the dataframes in the dictionary (DwInt) is the Satellite ID

2. Satellite Informations (SatInfo):
Data format is assumed to be a Pandas DataFrame of the structure
-index- | -Satellite_ID- | -c1- | -c2- | -SatLocation_Long- | -SatLocation_lat- | -Sat_Altitude- | -d_min- | -d_max- | -d_status- | -e_min- | -e_max- | -e_status- 
The information on c1, c2, d_x's and e_x's can be found in the same doc.

3. Observation Tasks (ObsvTasks):
Data format is assumed to be a Pandas DataFrame of the structure
-index- | -Obsv_Task_ID- | -StripLocation_Long- | -StripLocation_Lat- | -Strip_Length- 

Assumptions:
    1.	Satellites in concern are Geo-Stationary Satellites â€“ Orbiting over the Equator or in concentric circles with respect to Latitudes 
    for simplification of Distance/Time to the observation strip calculations.
    2.	Strip Location Parameter used in the script is considered to the west-most point of the strip, mid-point across width.
    3.	The influence of width of the Strip is neglected in computing Observation time.
    4.	Geographic Coordinate System (Latitude and Longitude) is used to represent the Location of the Satellite and the Observation Strip. 
    An added parameter of Altitude exists for the Satellite.
    5.	Earth velocity: 1670 kmph; Earth Radius: 6378.137 km. Distance units are in Kilometres and Time units are in Hours.
    6.	Each degree of Latitude is considered to be 110.567 km.
    7.	Setting Up of the satellite can be finished before starting observation.
